# 2016 Climate model

 - NOVEMBER-DECEMBER-JANUARY (NDJ)

 - MARCH-APRIL-MAY (MAM)

THE SEASONAL OUTLOOKS FROM NDJ 2015 THROUGH MAM 2016 RELY PRIMARILY ON THE 
TYPICAL CIRCULATION RESPONSE TO EL NINO CONDITIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED 
TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION IMPACTS AS DETERMINED BY REGRESSION-BASED 
STATISTICAL MODELS AS WELL AS EL NINO COMPOSITES. THE NORTH AMERICAN 
MULTI-MODEL ENSEMBLE (NMME) AND THE INTERNATIONAL MULTI-MODEL ENSEMBLE (IMME), 
WHICH INCLUDE THE NCEP CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM (CFS), PLAYED A LARGE ROLE AS 
WELL. OUTLOOKS FOR MJJ 2016 THROUGH ASO 2016 RELY PRIMARILY ON THE CPC 
CONSOLIDATION FORECAST THAT COMBINES THE SMLR, CCA AND OCN STATISTICAL MODELS 
WITH THE CFS DYNAMICAL MODEL IN SEASONS FOR WHICH IT IS AVAILABLE. THE 
EXPECTATION IS FOR ENSO NEUTRAL CONDITIONS DURING THIS PERIOD. BASED ON THE 
BEHAVIOR OF SST ANOMALIES AFTER SEVERAL PAST STRONG EL NINO EVENTS AND THE CPC 
CONSOLIDATION NINO3.4 SST FORECAST, POTENTIAL LA NINA CONDITIONS WERE 
CONSIDERED BEGINNING IN SON 2016 THROUGH NDJ 2016-2017. 
 
PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - NDJ 2015 TO NDJ 2016 
 
TEMPERATURE 
 
THE TEMPERATURE OUTLOOKS FROM NDJ 2015-16 THROUGH MAM 2016 WERE ONLY SLIGHTLY 
CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS SET OF OUTLOOKS RELEASED IN MID-SEPTEMBER. FOR NDJ 
2015-16, THERE ARE ENHANCED ODDS FOR ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR ALASKA, THE 
FAR WEST AND ALONG THE NORTHERN TIER OF THE CONUS. THE GREATEST PROBABILITIES 
ARE FOR THE ALASKA PANHANDLE AND IN THE CONTIGUOUS U.S. ALONG THE WEST COAST 
AND NORTHERN TIER OF THE CONUS FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TO THE GREAT LAKES. 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE FAVORED FOR A REGION THAT INCLUDES PARTS OF THE 
SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
 
THROUGH THE WINTER AND INTO SPRING 2016, ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES REMAIN 
FAVORED FOR MUCH OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CONUS WHILE THE COVERAGE FOR 
ELEVATED ODDS OF BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPANDS EASTWARD TO INCLUDE THE 
SOUTHEAST. FORECAST COVERAGE MAXIMIZES IN JFM AND FMA 2016 WHEN EL NINO IMPACTS 
TYPICALLY ARE THE GREATEST. THE FORECAST EVOLUTION IS BASED ON TOOLS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE EL NINO TELECONNECTION, DYNAMICAL MODEL GUIDANCE AND ABOVE NORMAL 
PACIFIC OCEAN SSTS, FOR AREAS ALONG THE WEST COAST. CONSIDERATIONS OF A STRONG 
EL NINO EVENT RESULT IN A SLIGHT SHIFT SOUTHWARD OF FAVORED ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES FOR SOME AREAS OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND MID-ATLANTIC AND A REDUCTION 
IN COVERAGE AND PROBABILITIES FOR BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES IN PARTS OF THE 
SOUTHEAST IN DJF 2015-16 AND JFM AND FMA 2016. 
 
THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF THE FORECAST IS THE EXTENT OF COLD AIR INTRUSIONS 
INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST A MIDST A STRONG EL NINO. FORECAST TOOLS 
DIVERGE IN THESE AREAS DURING THE WINTER MONTHS. THE CFS INDICATES EL NINO IS 
BY FAR THE DOMINANT PLAYER WITH A WARM FORECAST ACROSS THE MAJORITY OF THE 
CONUS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SOME STATISTICAL FORECAST TOOLS SUCH AS THE CA, CCA 
AND SMLR HINT AT A COLDER FORECAST FOR THE SOUTHEAST WHERE PREDICTORS ARE 
TAPPING INTO CONTINUED WARM NORTH PACIFIC SSTS. STRONG EL NINO CONDITIONS, AND 
THE ASSOCIATED CIRCULATION, HOWEVER, COULD VERY WELL MODIFY THIS STRUCTURE. THE 
FORECAST IS A BALANCE BETWEEN ALL OF THESE FACTORS. 
 
A TRANSITION TO ENSO NEUTRAL CONDITIONS IS FAVORED DURING LATE SPRING AND 
SUMMER 2016 SO THE DRIVER OF THE OUTLOOK FROM MJJ THROUGH ASO 2016 IS THE CPC 
CONSOLIDATION FORECAST AND FAVORS ENHANCED ODDS OF ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
FOR THE WESTERN CONUS AND PARTS OF ALASKA, THE SOUTHERN CONUS AND NORTHEAST AT 
VARIOUS TIMES DURING THIS PERIOD. 
 
A COMBINATION OF THE CPC CONSOLIDATION FORECAST AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF LA NINA CONDITIONS ARE THE DRIVER FOR THE OUTLOOKS FROM SON 2015 
THROUGH NDJ 2015-16. PROBABILITIES INDICATED ON THE FORECAST MAPS ARE ONLY 
SLIGHTLY TILTED BASED ON LA NINA ACROSS SOME AREAS OF THE INTERIOR AND SOUTHERN 
CONUS AT THE CURRENT TIME GIVEN THE FORECAST LEAD. A VERY HIGH PROBABILITY OF 
ABOVE-NORMAL TEMPERATURES IS INDICATED FOR THE NORTH SLOPE OF ALASKA DURING THE 
OND SEASON DUE TO ANOMALOUSLY OPEN SEA ICE DURING THAT TIME OF YEAR. 
 
PRECIPITATION 
 
THE NDJ 2015-16 PRECIPITATION OUTLOOK FAVORS ABOVE-MEDIAN PRECIPITATION FROM 
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER OF THE CONUS AND UP THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD TO THE MID-ATLANTIC. BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION IS MOST LIKELY FOR 
PARTS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST, NORTHERN ROCKIES AND HIGH PLAINS, AND GREAT 
LAKES. BOTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH COASTS OF ALASKA ARE FAVORED TO SEE 
ABOVE-MEDIAN PRECIPITATION OVER THE SEASON. ENHANCED CHANCES OF ABOVE-MEDIAN 
PRECIPITATION FOR THE NORTHERN COAST OF ALASKA ARE RELATED TO THE ANOMALOUSLY 
OPEN SEA ICE CONDITIONS. 
 
AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THE WINTER AND INTO THE SPRING OF 2016, THE ABOVE 
HIGHLIGHTED PATTERNS ARE ADJUSTED SO THAT BOTH COVERAGE AND PROBABILITIES ARE 
MAXIMIZED IN JFM 2016. PROBABILITIES PEAK AT GREATER THAN 70% FOR FLORIDA AND 
GREATER THAN 60% FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA. FOR BELOW MEDIAN 
PRECIPITATION, ODDS INCREASE TO GREATER THAN 50% DURING THIS SEASON IN TWO 
AREAS, THE NORTHERN ROCKIES AND GREAT LAKES. THE EL NINO TELECONNECTION BASED 
ON COMPOSITES AND OTHER ASSOCIATED FORECAST TOOLS ALONG WITH THE NMME AND ITS 
COMPONENTS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE OUTLOOK THROUGH MAM 2016. 
 
CONSISTENT WITH A SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD SHIFTED STORM TRACK DURING EL NINO AND 
NMME DYNAMICAL MODEL GUIDANCE, BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION IS HIGHLIGHTED FOR 
CENTRAL MAINLAND ALASKA FROM DJF 2015-16 THROUGH MAM 2016. DECADAL TRENDS AS 
DEPICTED IN SOME OF THE STATISTICAL FORECAST TOOLS IS THE DRIVER FOR THE SMALL 
HIGHLIGHTED AREAS FROM MJJ THROUGH JAS 2016. 
 
AT THE EXTENDED LEADS, THE POTENTIAL FOR LA NINA CONDITIONS ARE THE PRIMARY 
BASIS FOR THE VERY SLIGHT TILT IN THE ODDS FOR BELOW MEDIAN PRECIPITATION FOR 
SOME AREAS ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER OF THE CONUS AND LATER THE SOUTH COAST OF 
ALASKA AND FOR ABOVE MEDIAN PRECIPITATION FOR THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST FROM SON 
2016 THROUGH NDJ 2016-17.
